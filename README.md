# Angular-Bootstrap

This is an example project created to show you how you can get started with AngularCli development. I used this
technology to quickly spin up my first version of my blog.

To run the solution:

1) [Clone this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
2) Navigate to the _blog_ directory `cd blog`
3) run command `npm install`
4) run command `ng serve`
5) The console should show the location of where the application was deployed. (Example: http://localhost:4200).
6) Navigate to the deployed application location and you should see the blog example.
